# Description
Search across a variety of data sources for exploits and use facets to get summary information. Ex: Get-ShodanExploitSearch -Query [string] -Facet [string] -API [string]

## Prerequisites
You will need to have downloaded and installed the script already. Please see [Downloading](https://github.com/makeitbetter/Shodan_PS#Download) and [Installing](https://github.com/makeitbetter/Shodan_PS#Install) for further instruction.

## Usage
Run the script by entering the module name with the query parameter followed by the query in quotes, then the optional facet parameter with a single option or comma separated list of properties.
Which in turn is followed by the API parameter followed by the api key in quotes. For the following example all the facets are selected.
There are a number of query types you can use, for example searching by the author of the exploit/vuln. 
Please view the Shodan [documentation](https://developer.shodan.io/api/exploits/rest) for a full list.
